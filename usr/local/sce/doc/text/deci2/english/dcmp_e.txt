1.  Overview
============
  The DECI2 protocol is not equipped with functions such as error 
  detection, and is not perfectly reliable.  In order to reinforce 
  the reliability of the DECI2, the DCMP provides a means of 
  notification when an error occurs.  The protocol number of the DCMP 
  protocol is DCMP = 0x1.   

  When the DECI2 Manager/dsnetm find an error in the processing of 
  the DECI2 packets, they notify the application and the protocol 
  diver of it via the DCMP message. 

  In ordinary cases, the application and the protocol driver do not 
  have to transmit the DCMP message.  The notification via the DCMP 
  message is given even when higher level protocols are locked.  To 
  avoid the infinite repetition in error reporting, however, errors 
  concerning the DCMP message are not notified. 

  The DCMP message is also used when status changes of each node are 
  notified to the application and protocol driver besides the errors or 
  a route is established between the dsnetm and the DECI2 Manager. 


2.  Message Format
===========================
  The DCMP message has a format in which the DECI2 header, the DCMP 
  header below and data are arranged in that order. The DCMP header has 
  the following format. 

       3                   2                   1

                            Figure 1  DCMP Header

  There are following Message Types.

  DCMP_TYPE_CONNECT   0
  DCMP_TYPE_ECHO      1
  DCMP_TYPE_STATUS    2
  DCMP_TYPE_ERROR     3

  The DCMP_TYPE_CONNECT is used when a route is established between 
  the dsnetm and the DECI2 Manager.  The application and the protocol 
  driver never transmit and receive this message. 

  The DCMP_TYPE_ECHO is a message to test whether or not the route is 
  maintained.  In ordinary cases, the application and the protocol 
  driver do not have to transmit and receive this message. 

  The DCMP_TYPE_STATUS is a message to be transmitted from the DECI2 
  Manager/dsnetm to all the applications and the protocol drivers when 
  a change in status is generated in a certain node. 

  The DCMP_TYPE_ERROR is a message to be transmitted at the occurrence 
  of an error from the DECI2 Manager/dsnetm to the application or 
  the protocol driver which has generated the error. 


3.  Message
===============
  The following are detailed descriptions of each Type of the DCMP 
  messages. 


3.1 DCMP_TYPE_CONNECT
----------------------
  Connect/disconnect message from the dsnetm to the DECI2 Manager

       3                   2                   1

                     Figure 2  DCMP_TYPE_CONNECT Message

  Code
    DCMP_CODE_CONNECT        0	// connect request
    DCMP_CODE_CONNECTR       1	// connect reply
    DCMP_CODE_DISCONNECT     2	// disconnect request
    DCMP_CODE_DISCONNECTR    3	// disconnect reply

  Result
    In reply messages, 0 is returned for success and the following 
    values are returned for errors.

    DCMP_ERR_INVALDEST       1	// destination invalid
    DCMP_ERR_ALREADYCONN     2	// already connected
    DCMP_ERR_NOTCONNECT      3	// not connected

  EE Boot parameter
  IOP Boot parameter
    The first 2 words show the initialization parameter for the EE, 
    and the latter 2 words show that for the IOP.  The specification has 
    not yet been fixed, so the description is omitted. 

  The DCMP_CODE_CONNECT and DCMP_CODE_DISCONNECT messages are messages 
  requesting for connection and disconnection sent from the dsnetm to 
  the DECI2 Manager.  The dsnetm transmits these messages on starting 
  and resetting. 

  The DECI2 Manager receives the DCMP_CODE_CONNECT message, and then 
  returns the DCMP_CODE_CONNECTR message to the dsnetm.  As for 
  the DCMP_CODE_DISCONNECT message, the DECI2 Manager works in the same 
  manner.
 
  The DECI2 Manager judges that the route with the dsnetm is kept 
  connected until the DCMP_CODE_DISCONNECT message arrives. 


3.2 DCMP_TYPE_ECHO
-------------------
  Message for route testing

       3                   2                   1

                     Figure 3  DCMP_TYPE_ECHO Message

  Code
    DCMP_CODE_ECHO           0	// echo
    DCMP_CODE_ECHOR          1	// echo reply

  Identifier
  Sequence Number
    This is data which helps confirm matching between the DCMP_CODE_ECHO 
    message and the DCMP_CODE_ECHOR message. 

  Data
    This is optional data up to 32 bytes.

  The DCMP_CODE_ECHO message is used to test whether a route is kept 
  connected.  The DECI2 Manager receives this message, exchanges 
  the source and the destination in the DECI2 header, changes the Code 
  to the DCMP_CODE_ECHOR, and returns a reply. 


3.3 DCMP_TYPE_STATUS
---------------------
  Message for status notification

       3                   2                   1

                     Figure 4  DCMP_TYPE_STATUS Message

  Code
    DCMP_CODE_CONNECTED      0	// !NOCONNECT
    DCMP_CODE_PROTO          1	// !NOPROTO
    DCMP_CODE_UNLOCKED       2	// !LOCKED
    DCMP_CODE_SPACE          3	// !NOSPACE
    DCMP_CODE_ROUTE          4	// !NOROUTE

  Protocol/Node ID
    The protocol number is specified for the DCMP_CODE_PROTO, and Node 
    ID is specified for the DCMP_CODE_CONNECT and the DCMP_CODE_ROUTE.  
    For other cases, 0 is specified. 

  The messages of the DCMP_TYPE_STATUS type are used to notify each 
  application and protocol driver of the DECI2 environment status.  
  The application and protocol driver which have been stopped for 
  an error can obtain the timing of retry according to this message. 

  The DCMP_CODE_CONNECTED is a message to provide notification that 
  a route has been established between the dsnetm and the DECI2 
  Manager.  This message is transmitted directly from the dsnetm to 
  all the applications and from the DECI2 Manager to all the protocol 
  drivers.

  The DCMP_CODE_PROTO is a message to be transmitted to other nodes when 
  an application or a protocol driver is newly registered.  The DECI2 
  Manager/dsnetm in the node, which has received this message, sends 
  the message to an application or a protocol driver using the same 
  protocol, if there is.

  As a special condition, the DCMP_CODE_PROTO is not issued to 
  the protocol drivers, which are surely registered on startup of 
  the target implemented by SCE. 

  The DCMP_CODE_UNLOCKED is a message to provide notification that 
  the lock state has been released.  The DCMP_CODE_SPACE is a message 
  to provide notification that the NOSPACE state of the DECI2 
  Manager/dsnetm has been released.  They are broadcasted to 
  the applications and the protocol drivers registered in the node in 
  use and in other nodes respectively. 

  The DCMP_CODE_ROUTE is a special message transmitted and received only 
  between the dsnetm and the DECI2 Manager. This message is never 
  transmitted to the application and the protocol driver. It is used 
  when the dsnetm establishes a route.

                     Figure 5  DCMP_TYPE_ERROR Message

  Code
    DCMP_CODE_NOROUTE        0	// no route to node
    DCMP_CODE_NOPROTO        1	// protocol unreachable
    DCMP_CODE_LOCKED         2	// locked
    DCMP_CODE_NOSPACE        3	// deci2 manager/dsnetm buffer full
    DCMP_CODE_INVALHEAD      4	// invalid header
    DCMP_CODE_NOCONNECT      5	// not connected

  The messages of the DCMP_TYPE_ERROR type provide notification 
  from the DECI2 Manager/dsnetm to an application or a protocol 
  driver, which has issued a packet, that an error has occurred 
  in the processing of the DECI2 packet.  In short, the value of 
  the Source field of the packet, which has generated the error, 
  enters in the Destination field of the DECI2 header.  
  The notification to the protocol driver is given as a return 
  value of a function in the case of an immediately recognizable 
  error.  For other cases, however, the above message is used.  
  All the errors are notified via this message between the dsnetm 
  and the application. 

  DECI2 Manager/dsnetm judges which application or protocol driver 
  should be notified of the error from the Source field and Protocol 
  field of the DECI2 header of the packet which has caused the error.  
  
  The DCMP_CODE_NOROUTE is a special message to be transmitted and 
  received only between the dsnetm and the DECI2 Manager.  This 
  message is never transmitted to the application and the protocol 
  driver. 

  The DCMP_CODE_NOPROTO is a message which provides notification that 
  the protocol driver with the specified protocol number has not been 
  registered in the node of the destination.  

  DCMP_CODE_LOCKED is a message to provide notification that the node 
  of the destination is being locked by an application or a protocol 
  driver, which uses another protocol.

  The DCMP_CODE_NOSPACE is a message to provide notification that 
  the node of the destination and the node to perform relay could not 
  secure the memory, which is necessary to transmit the DECI2 packet.

  The DCMP_CODE_INVALHEAD is a message which provides notification that 
  therre is an error in the DECI2 header information.  This message is 
  transmitted only from the dsnetm to the application.  In other 
  situations, this notification is not given because the destination 
  cannot be specified due to unreliable header information. 

  The DCMP_CODE_NOCONNECT is a message which provides notification that 
  a route with the node of the destination has not been established.
